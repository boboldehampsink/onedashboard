DEPRECATED - One Dashboard plugin for Craft CMS
=================

This plugin will install the admin's widgets for every new CP user,
so you can have more control over the default user widgets.


Important:
The plugin's folder should be named "onedashboard"

Deprecated
=================
With the release of Craft 3 on 4-4-2018, this plugin has been deprecated. You can still use this with Craft 2 but you are encouraged to use (and develop) a Craft 3 version. At this moment, I have no plans to do so.

Changelog
=================
### 0.1.2 ###
 - Now also saves the widget colspans

### 0.1.1 ###
- Don't interfere with console commands

### 0.1 ###
- Initial push to GitHub
